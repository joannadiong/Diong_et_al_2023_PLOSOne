NOTE re reporting guidelines listed at the start. These are only an indirect reference if I clicked the ICMJE link. It is a typical Taylor Francis standard guidelines document with some adjustment for the particular journal,1,It was confusing as there are the general guidelines for Taylor and Francis journals with a mention of the IMJCE policies separately.  One could spend a lot of time looking for minor inconsistencies.  NOT simple for an author - better for them to go to recent papers published in the journal itself!
