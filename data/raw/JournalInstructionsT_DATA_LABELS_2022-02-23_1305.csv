Experimental Physiology is committed to encouraging the free exchange of scientific information and to promote progress in all areas of physiological research. Experimental Physiology requires, as a condition for publication, that nucleic acid and protein sequences, microarray data and data obtained using high throughput sequencing techniques, which support the results in the paper, should be archived in an appropriate public database (see below) and must be accessible without restriction from the date of publication.    Experimental Physiology requires the provision of a Data Availability Statement for all papers reporting original data, both in the manuscript and in the appropriate field during submission.  The Data Availability Statement should describe the availability of these data. If any data cannot be shared, the reason(s) should also be outlined in this statement. Authors must include in their Statement a link to the repository they have used (if applicable), reference the data in the appropriate sections(s) of their manuscript and cite the data they have shared in the References section. Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly available/archived.   If sharing data compromises ethical standards or legal requirements then authors are not expected to share them, but should note this in their Statement.
